The Behavioral Category

Behavioral patterns streamline messages between unrelated objects in your code by delegating how objects can
communicate. They encapsulate the communication behavior to decouple messages between senders and receivers.

Behavioral Patterns include:

    Iterator
    Mediator
    Observer
    Visitor
