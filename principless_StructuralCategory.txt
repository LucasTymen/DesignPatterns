The Structural Category

Structural design patterns handle relationships between objects. They define how objects and classes can be composed to
provide new functionality to objects or create larger structures. For example, an object can be used in the definition
of another object to make new functions available, or classes can inherit from super classes.

Structural patterns include:

    Facade
    Proxy
    Flyweight
    Adapter
    Decorator
    Composite
    Bridge
